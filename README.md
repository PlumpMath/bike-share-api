# Bike Share API

If you ran this code, it would generate a REST API from BmoreBikeShare's data sets.

Not saying you should, because ToS or whatever. But you, like, could.

## Specific directions.

First, have Docker and `docker-compose` installed. And `make`.

```
$ make
```

Boom. You're off to the races.
